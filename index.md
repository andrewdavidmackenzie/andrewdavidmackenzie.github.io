Welcome to my home page. Here you can find:

* [Blog](/blog) - mostly about programming, but also has some random stuff
* [Pongcast](/pongcast) - a web hosted, keyboard controlled version of my Pong clone for the Chromecast. If you want to 
  try this on your big screen, then you can find the Android app to run it on your Chromecast on 
  the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.mackenzie.pongcast)
* [Flow](/flow) - Online book or guide (including linked code documentation) for my `flow` project for dataflow
driven programming, written in rust
