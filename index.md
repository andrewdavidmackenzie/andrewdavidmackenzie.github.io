Welcome to my home page. Here you can find:

## Blog
* [Blog](/blog) - mostly about programming, but also has some random personal stuff

## Flow project
Flow is my project where I explore the paradigm of dataflow driven programming, written in rust. 
Here you can find:
* [The Guide](http://andrewdavidmackenzie.github.io/flow/) to it, plus linked code documentation, generated from the
  source code repo using `mdbook`
* [flow Repo](https://github.com/andrewdavidmackenzie/flow/) Source code on GitHub, plus issues and
  the [GH Project](https://github.com/andrewdavidmackenzie/flow/projects/2) I use to manage it
  
## Chromecast utilities and games
* Pongcast - my clone of the classic "Pong" game for the Chromecast. 
    * If you want to try this on your big screen, then you can find
  the [Android app on Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.mackenzie.pongcast)
    * The same "receiver" part of the Chromecast app can also be used as a browser based, keyboard controlled version of the game.
