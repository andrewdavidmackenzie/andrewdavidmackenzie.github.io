Welcome to my home page. Here you can find:

## Blog
* [Blog](/blog) - mostly about programming, but also has some random personal stuff

## libproc-rs
* For some strange reason I decided to tinker with rust bindings to the MacOS X library "libproc" that is used to 
  get information about running processes in macos/darwin. I published it as `libproc-rs` and a number of others 
  started using it and I have got a number of external contributions to it (to the extent I hardly recognize it!) 
    * [Github repo](https://github.com/andrewdavidmackenzie/libproc-rs)
    * [Crate published on crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/libproc)
    * [docs.rs for libproc-rs](https://docs.rs/libproc/0.14.1/libproc/)

## Flow project
Flow is my project where I explore the paradigm of dataflow driven programming, written in rust. 
Here you can find:
* [The flow book](http://andrewdavidmackenzie.github.io/flow/book/book_intro.html) describing the project and how to use it.
* [flow](https://github.com/andrewdavidmackenzie/flow/) source code repo on GitHub, plus the
  [Github kanban project](https://github.com/andrewdavidmackenzie/flow/projects/2) I use to manage work on it
  
## Chromecast utilities and games
* Pongcast - my clone of the classic "Pong" game for the Chromecast to allow you to play Pong on your Big Screen TV!
    * If you want to, you can find the [Android app on the Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.mackenzie.pongcast)
    * The "receiver" part of the Chromecast app can be used as a [browser based, keyboard controlled, version of the game](http://andrewdavidmackenzie.github.io/pongcast)
    * The [source code repo](https://github.com/andrewdavidmackenzie/pongcast) on Github
