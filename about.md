I'm from Bonar Bridge, in Sutherland in the Highlands of Scotland, but I have lived and worked in Barcelona, Spain 
(or surrounding area) since 1990, 30 years already!!!

I've worked as a Software Engineer, then Engineering Manager or Director all of my career. Most of it in Hewlett-Packard
then some time in a start-up of my own, then at Tuenti in Barcelona, then 3scale Network which was finally acquired
by Red Hat.

### Linked in
I don't update my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewdmackenzie/) much recently or use it much, 
but it maybe useful or of interest to someone.
