title: Hello World, and Mr Hide

Hi folks, 

I've decided to try my hand at publishing things I think about, learn about and build, on a Blog (again!).

I'm trying out doing that via GitHub and Jekyll static site generator, following the guide you can find at the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.

In the process, I blew away my minimal previous Github Pages website that had links to few things I'm playing with currently, so I'll paste them here to not loose them.

I plan to reconstruct a bit of history of things I have learned and done over the past couple of years, mainly my [flow project](https://github.com/andrewdavidmackenzie/flow/) I suspect.

So, here goes on another blogging experiment....let's see if I have the time and the stamina to keep it up long enough for it to make sense and be useful for others.

## Chromecast utilities and games

* SnakeCast ([Android App on PlayStore](https://play.google.com/store/search?q=snakecast) and [Hosted receiver app](https://andrewdavidmackenzie.github.io/snakecast/index.html))

## Flow Programming paradigm project
