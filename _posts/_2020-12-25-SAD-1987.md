title: 1987, Structured Analysis and Design
--- 

Ah... the good old days, when you were tools to sit down and think about a problem, and try and define it, then 
think on the solution and design it... _then_ start writing some code...

I was working at Hewlett-Packard, in their Telecommunications Division, making high-speed instruments for other
engineers to use to make high-speed things for you! :-)

I was in my second last year at University, in the "placement" period, where I worked one trimester and then all Summer
in industry before starting my last year at Uni.

To help maintain software quality and reliability, HP back then used a formal methodology called 
"Structured Analysis and Design".
